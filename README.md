# NRITurnBasedGame
This is a turn-based battle game where players engage in strategic combat against enemies.
The game starts with the player and an enemy taking positions on their respective battle stations. Each unit has unique stats, such as health points (HP) and attack damage, which are displayed on a heads-up display (HUD).

The gameplay involves alternating turns between the player and the enemy. On the playerâ€™s turn, they can attack the enemy, reducing their HP. The animations for attacks are visually represented using an animator component. The battle progresses as each side takes turns attacking until one of them is defeated.

The game emphasizes strategy and decision-making as players aim to defeat their opponents while keeping their own unit alive. Additionally, it features a dynamic dialogue system that narrates the battle, enhancing immersion and engagement.
